My personal website. Uses Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Jest.

Access at [asaltveit.github.io](asaltveit.github.io)

## Why I built it this way
- I wanted to learn Next.js and TailwindCSS.
- A focus on accessibility:
  - Color schemes were tested with https://www.realtimecolors.com/ and https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/
  - Dark mode was created.
  - Tabbability was tested.
- Mobile friendly:
  - Part of learning TailwindCSS
- Hosting: .github.io
  - It's free and comes with a URL.

 ## Future Work
 - 3D or other interesting effects with Three.js
